                    The website project based on CodeAcademy was critical in our learning of both website creation and programming. As first-year students in <br>
                    the School of IT and Engineering, we lacked coding knowledge, so these multi-module HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses came in handy. <br>
                    We learned how the front end is built with HTML, styled with CSS, and animated with JS. The following duties were divided equally among<br> the group members while successfully avoiding collisions:<br>
                    Raiq Abdurahmanli designed a logo and assisted in the coding of the Members page; Nijat assisted in the coding of the Website Project and<br> the Hour of Code page;
                    Nariman coded the structure of the website and created animations using JavaScript in the page while keeping <br>
                    everything under control; Firengiz Bekirli assisted in the development of the Members and Home pages.

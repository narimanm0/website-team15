                Team 15, aka. Reavers held the Hour of Code event at Baku School-Lyceum No.20 named after Arif Huseynzada on November 15th
                at 11 a.m. The goal of the event was to demonstrate that anyone can learn the fundamentals of programming. The participants were
                24 students ages ranging from 12 to 15. The event began with a brief introduction to ADA University, followed by teammates Nijat
                and Nariman teaching the underlying principles of coding on CODE.ORG with "The Classic Maze." Following that, we assisted the
                students trying to solve the puzzles. Certificates were distributed to students who successfully completed the puzzles at the end of
                the event. We, Team 15, would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Chinara Kazimova, an ICT teacher at the school, as well
                as Esmira Aghayeva, the school's Director, for allowing the project to take place.
